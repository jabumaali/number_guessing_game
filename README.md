	First Techdegree Project
 	This is my first TeamTreehouse Techdegree Project

	This project is a number guessing game, coded in python3.
	A random number between 1 and 100 is generated, and the user tries to guess it in as few tries as possible.
	
	This project includes some python basics such as try/except error handling, random number generation, input/output statements, and some loop control.
